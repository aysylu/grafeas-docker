# Grafeas Examples

## Python Client

### Installation

I built the test code in the 'python' folder using the following:

* Python 3.6 (installed via Brew on MacOSX)
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) was used to create a sandboxed environment for the project dependencies

I installed the [sample Python code](https://github.com/grafeas/client-python) from the Grafeas project and used that as a starting point.
